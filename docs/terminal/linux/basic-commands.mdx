# Basic Linux commands

## Goal

Learn essential commands to navigate directories, inspect files, and run basic terminal tasks.

## Prerequisites

- Access to a Linux or macOS terminal.
- Basic understanding of folders and files.

## Quick context

These commands are the starting point for server work, local development, and script automation.

## Steps

### 1) Locate yourself in the system

```bash
pwd
ls -la
```

- `pwd` shows your current path.
- `ls -la` lists files, including hidden ones and permissions.

### 2) Navigate directories

```bash
cd /tmp
cd ~
cd -
```

- `cd /tmp` moves to a specific path.
- `cd ~` returns to your home directory.
- `cd -` goes back to the previous directory.

### 3) Create, copy, move, and delete

```bash
mkdir demo-cli
touch demo-cli/notes.txt
cp demo-cli/notes.txt demo-cli/notes-copy.txt
mv demo-cli/notes-copy.txt demo-cli/notes-final.txt
rm demo-cli/notes-final.txt
```

### 4) Read and search content

```bash
echo "hello terminal" > demo-cli/notes.txt
cat demo-cli/notes.txt
grep "hello" demo-cli/notes.txt
```

Expected output:

```text
hello terminal
```

## Common errors

- `No such file or directory`: the path does not exist or is misspelled.
- `Permission denied`: you do not have enough permissions for the file or directory.

## Next steps

- Practice redirection with `>` and `>>`.
- Learn pipes with `|` to chain commands.
- Create a `.sh` script to automate repetitive tasks.
